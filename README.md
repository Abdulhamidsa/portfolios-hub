---------------------------------------
Todo 

- [ ] how do we structure the routes (AA will try to come up with a structure)
- [ ] add validation layer to all routes (DC will provide a example of how to do this)
- [ ] Seeding the data will require a deep understanding of the data structure
- [ ] what other models do we need to add to the backend
- [ ] add typescript to the backend
- [ ] update dependencies to latest version
- [ ] setup .env file with NODE_ENV, PORT, MONGO_URI, JWT_SECRET - currently its using a SECRETS file
- [ ] Evaluate the need for expressListRoutes
- [ ] user PORT 4000 for local development - for the backend instead of 8080
- [ ] delete and evaluate the need for PRE hooks in mongoose models
- [ ] eveluate the need for --es-module-specifier-resolution=node in the package.json file
- [ ] general error handler - consider adding sentry
